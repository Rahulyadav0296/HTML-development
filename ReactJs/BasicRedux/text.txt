1: Why sholud i use Redux.
Ans : Redux is a pattern and library for mananging and updatig application state, using events called "actions".

Radux helps you manage, "global' state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.

Redux is more useful when : 
1: we have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app.
2: the app state is updated frequently over time.
3: the logic to update the state may be complex
4: The app has a medium or large - sized codebase and might be worked on by many people.

A reducer is a function that recieves the 
current state and an action object  
decides how to update the state if necessary, 
and returns the new state: 
(state, action) => newState

Reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.
