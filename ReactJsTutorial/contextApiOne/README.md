# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<!-- The problem with passing props 
in React, passsing props is a fundamental conceot that enable a parent component to share data with its child component as well as other component within an applications 
 -->

 <!-- with help of context api : Context API allows data to be passed through a component tree withourt having to pass proos manualy at every lvel
 Context API consists of two main components: the context Provider amd the contect consumer.the context provider is responsible for creating and managing context which hold the data to be shared between components. and the consumer is used to access the context adnd its data from within a component. -->
